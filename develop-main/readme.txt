There are two folders here:

data/ "Anything that has to do with data(preprocessing, loading, etc) will be in this folder."

models/ "Anything that has to with the model will be in this folder."

main.py

the main.py is the main program that will take inputs, arguments and combining all the classes together.

Code of conduct:

You can create multiple calsses in one file, it is best to avoid creating too many files but also keep in mind that don't put two unrelated thing in one .py file as it may be confusing for other people.
