-- Week3 meeting 18-09-2019 --
Decision time: should we use GIT or Google Collab
Polarity sentiment analysis: positive, negative or neutral.

Gosse tips:
1. Multilingual word embeddings (second paper by Marion) --> not just monolingual such as English or Spanish.
2. Get more recent data. Spanish data especially is very skewed. So try to find more annotated data. 
	- Scrape data from Twitter or Facebook and annotate it yourselves? 
	- Or throw in monolingual data? 
	- Find English Twitter data on disk at RUG (at least till 2016). Find code-mixed 	with Spanish from there. In those find smileys --> use these to automatically 		conclude positive/negative.	- Distant supervision ? Method of automatically annotating new data?
3. Use different/all corpori --> Gaetana found a corpus with annotated. 
4. Can also choose to ignore the label completely.
5. Think about whether the major language is EN/HI/SP, choose monolingual corpus for that?

For next meeting:
- Find actual training data (Gaetana)
- Find other datasets (Toki)
- Data distribution (Marion & Louis)
